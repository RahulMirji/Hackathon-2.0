## üîß Configuration Required

### 1. Firestore Security Rules

Deploy these rules to Firebase Console:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /examSessions/{examId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                            resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      
      match /{subcollection}/{doc} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                              get(/databases/$(database)/documents/examSessions/$(examId)).data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      }
    }
    
    match /examResults/{resultId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow create, update: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Firestore Indexes

Create composite indexes for:
- `examSessions`: `userId` + `createdAt` (descending)
- `violations`: `examId` + `timestamp` (descending)
- `answers`: `examId` + `section` + `questionNumber`
