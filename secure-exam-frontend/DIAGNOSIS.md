# Diagnosis - Why Mock Questions Are Showing

## 🔍 What We Found

Based on your console logs, here's exactly what's happening:

### ✅ Good News:
1. **API is being called** - ✓
2. **Response is 200 OK** - ✓  
3. **Stream is working** - ✓
4. **Data is being received** - ✓

### ❌ The Problem:
```
❌ [CODING PAGE] Error in stream: Failed to parse JSON
```

**The AI API is returning data, but it's NOT valid JSON.**

## 📊 The Flow:

```
1. Your app calls /api/generate-questions ✓
2. API calls AI service ✓
3. AI service responds with 200 OK ✓
4. AI streams back data ✓
5. Data received: "Failed to parse JSON" ❌
6. Falls back to mock questions ✓
```

## 🐛 Root Cause:

The AI is likely returning something like:

**Option 1: Text instead of JSON**
```
Here are some coding questions:
[{"id": 1, "title": "Two Sum"...}]
```

**Option 2: Markdown-wrapped JSON**
```
```json
[{"id": 1, "title": "Two Sum"...}]
```
```

**Option 3: Incomplete JSON**
```
[{"id": 1, "title": "Two Sum", "description": "Given an array...
```

**Option 4: Invalid JSON syntax**
```
[{id: 1, title: "Two Sum"}]  // Missing quotes
```

## 🔧 What I Just Fixed:

1. **Better JSON extraction** - Now tries to find `[...]` in the text
2. **More detailed error logging** - Shows what the AI actually returned
3. **Buffer preview** - Shows first 200 chars of failed parse

## 🧪 Test Again:

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. **Check console** for these NEW logs:

```
📄 [API] Raw buffer (first 500 chars): ...
📄 [API] JSON string (first 500 chars): ...
📄 [API] Full buffer that failed to parse: ...
📄 [CODING PAGE] Buffer preview: ...
```

These will show us **exactly what the AI is returning**.

## 🎯 Next Steps:

### If you see the buffer content:

**Scenario A: AI returns text explanation**
```
📄 [API] Raw buffer: "I'll generate coding questions for you..."
```
**Fix**: Update the prompt to be more strict about JSON-only output

**Scenario B: AI returns markdown**
```
📄 [API] Raw buffer: "```json\n[{...}]\n```"
```
**Fix**: Already handled, but might need better regex

**Scenario C: AI returns incomplete JSON**
```
📄 [API] Raw buffer: "[{\"id\": 1, \"title\": \"Two Sum\", \"desc"
```
**Fix**: AI timeout or token limit - increase timeout or reduce count

**Scenario D: AI returns invalid JSON**
```
📄 [API] Raw buffer: "[{id: 1, title: 'Two Sum'}]"
```
**Fix**: Prompt needs to specify double quotes

## 🔑 Possible Solutions:

### Solution 1: Test AI API Directly
```bash
# Use the provided test script which loads credentials from .env.local
./test-ai-api.sh
```

### Solution 2: Update the Prompt
Make it more explicit:
```typescript
const prompt = `Generate EXACTLY ${count} coding problems.

CRITICAL: Return ONLY a JSON array. No markdown, no explanations, no text before or after.

Format: [{"id":1,"title":"...","description":"...","constraints":[...],"examples":[...],"testCases":[...],"difficulty":"easy"}]

Start your response with [ and end with ]`
```

### Solution 3: Use Non-Streaming
If streaming is causing issues:
```typescript
stream: false  // Instead of stream: true
```

### Solution 4: Increase Temperature
Lower temperature for more predictable output:
```typescript
temperature: 0.3  // Instead of 0.7
```

## 📝 What to Share:

After refreshing, share these from console:
1. `📄 [API] Raw buffer (first 500 chars): ...`
2. `📄 [API] Full buffer that failed to parse: ...`
3. `📄 [CODING PAGE] Buffer preview: ...`

This will tell us exactly what the AI is returning and how to fix it!

## 🎉 Success Will Look Like:

```
📄 [API] Raw buffer (first 500 chars): [{"id":1,"title":"Two Sum"...
🔍 [API] Attempting to parse JSON...
✅ [API] Successfully parsed questions: 2
📋 [API] Questions: [...]
📤 [API] Sent complete signal with questions
✅ [CODING PAGE] Questions received from AI!
🎉 [CODING PAGE] Successfully loaded AI questions!
```

Then you'll see AI-generated questions instead of mock ones!
