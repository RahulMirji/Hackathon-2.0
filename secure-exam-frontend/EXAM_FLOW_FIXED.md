# Exam Flow - Fixed Navigation

## ✅ Root Cause Identified & Fixed

**Problem**: The consent page was navigating directly to `/exam/environment`, skipping the section selection page.

**Solution**: Updated consent page to navigate to `/exam/sections` first.

## Complete User Flow (Fixed)

```
1. /exam/compatibility-check
   ↓
2. /exam/id-verification  
   ↓
3. /exam/consent
   ↓ (FIXED: Now goes to sections instead of environment)
4. /exam/sections ← NEW STEP ADDED TO FLOW
   ↓ (User clicks MCQ 1, 2, or 3)
5. /exam/environment?section=mcq1|mcq2|mcq3
   ↓ (User completes exam)
6. /exam/submission
   ↓
7. /exam/results
```
