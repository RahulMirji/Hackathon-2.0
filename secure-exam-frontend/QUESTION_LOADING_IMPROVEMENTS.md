# Question Loading System Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Stream Controller Error ‚úÖ
**Problem:** `TypeError: Invalid state: Controller is already closed`
- The stream controller was being called after it was already closed
- Multiple enqueue attempts on a closed controller caused crashes

**Solution:**
- Added `controllerClosed` flag to track controller state
- Created `safeEnqueue()` and `safeClose()` wrapper functions
- All controller operations now check state before executing
- Prevents double-close and enqueue-after-close errors

### 2. Auto-Regeneration ‚úÖ
**Problem:** No retry mechanism when API calls failed
- Single failure would immediately fall back to mock questions
- Transient network issues caused unnecessary mock usage

**Solution:**
- Implemented `loadSectionWithRetry()` with configurable retry attempts
- Default: 2 retries (3 total attempts) before falling back to mock
- 1-second delay between retries to avoid overwhelming the API
- Retry logic triggered on:
  - Stream errors
  - Parse failures
  - Empty responses
  - API errors with `shouldRetry` flag

### 3. All Sections Using API ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Only coding section was using AI API, others used mock
- MCQ sections (mcq1, mcq2, mcq3) had prompts but weren't being called

**Solution:**
- Verified all sections have proper prompts configured
- All sections now use the same loading pipeline:
  1. Check cache first
  2. Try API with retry logic
  3. Fall back to mock only after all retries exhausted
- Added source tracking to distinguish API vs mock vs cache

### 4. Enhanced Logging ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Insufficient logging made debugging difficult

**Solution:**
- Added unique request IDs for tracking individual API calls
- Comprehensive logging at every stage:
  - Request initiation with timestamp
  - Retry attempts
  - Buffer size updates (every 500 chars)
  - Partial question parsing
  - Final validation
  - Error details with context
- Section-level logging:
  - Cache hits
  - Loading progress
  - Question counts
  - Source tracking (API/mock/cache)
  - Summary report after all sections loaded

## New Features

### Request Tracking
Each API request gets a unique ID: `${timestamp}-${random}`
- Makes it easy to trace a specific request through logs
- Format: `[API-1729876543210-abc123]`

### Source Indicators
UI now shows where questions came from:
- ‚úì AI Generated - Questions from API
- ‚ö† Using Fallback - Mock questions used
- ‚úì Cached - Previously loaded questions

### Progressive Loading
- Partial questions displayed as they arrive
- Sections enabled when ‚â•3 questions ready
- Real-time progress updates in UI

### Validation
- Coding questions: Validates test cases exist
- MCQ questions: Validates structure and options
- Logs warnings for malformed questions

## Configuration

### Retry Settings
```typescript
const MAX_RETRIES = 2              // Total attempts: 3
const FALLBACK_TIMEOUT = 15000     // 15 seconds
const MIN_QUESTIONS_TO_START = 3   // Enable section threshold
```

### Question Counts
```typescript
mcq1: 25 questions   // General & Technical
mcq2: 25 questions   // Coding & Programming
mcq3: 10 questions   // English Language
coding: 2 questions  // Programming Tasks
```

## Error Handling

### API Errors
1. First attempt fails ‚Üí Wait 1s ‚Üí Retry
2. Second attempt fails ‚Üí Wait 1s ‚Üí Retry
3. Third attempt fails ‚Üí Use mock questions

### Stream Errors
- Controller state tracked to prevent double-close
- Safe enqueue/close wrappers prevent crashes
- Expected JSON parse errors during streaming are silently handled
- Only unexpected errors are logged
- Detailed error logging with buffer preview on final failure

### Parse Errors
- Attempts to extract JSON from markdown
- Tries multiple parsing strategies
- Falls back to retry on parse failure
- Uses mock questions as last resort

## Logging Examples

### Successful Load
```
üîµ [API-1729876543210-abc123] POST /api/generate-questions called
üì¶ [API-1729876543210-abc123] Request: { section: 'mcq1', count: 25, retryAttempt: 0 }
üì° [API-1729876543210-abc123] Calling external AI API
üåä [API-1729876543210-abc123] Stream started
üìù [API-1729876543210-abc123] Buffer: 1000 chars
üìä [API-1729876543210-abc123] Parsed 10 questions
üìä [API-1729876543210-abc123] Parsed 20 questions
‚úÖ [API-1729876543210-abc123] Successfully parsed 25 questions
‚úì [API-1729876543210-abc123] Generated 25 mcq1 questions
```

### Retry Scenario
```
‚ùå [SECTIONS] mcq2 error: Failed to parse JSON
üîÑ [SECTIONS] Retrying mcq2...
üì° [SECTIONS] Loading mcq2 (attempt 2/3)...
‚úÖ [SECTIONS] mcq2 complete (25 questions from API)
```

### Fallback to Mock
```
‚ùå [SECTIONS] Failed to load coding after 3 attempts
üì¶ [SECTIONS] coding using mock questions (2 questions)
```

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. **Normal Load:** Clear cache and reload sections page
2. **Retry Logic:** Temporarily break API URL to trigger retries
3. **Cache Load:** Reload page after questions are cached
4. **Source Indicators:** Check UI labels under each section button

## Performance

- Parallel loading: All 4 sections load simultaneously
- Progressive display: Sections enable as questions arrive
- Smart caching: Cached questions load instantly
- Efficient retries: 1s delay prevents API spam
